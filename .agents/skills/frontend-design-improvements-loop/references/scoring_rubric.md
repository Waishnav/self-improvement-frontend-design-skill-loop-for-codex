Score each version against this rubric after screenshot capture.

## Dimensions

4. Typography craft
5. Text economy
6. Interaction quality
7. Visual finish (spacing/surfaces/details)

## Scale

- `0`: poor or missing
- `1`: acceptable but weak/inconsistent
- `2`: strong and consistent

## Release gate

- Any `0` in dimensions 1-7: do not keep as best candidate.
- Average score target: `>= 1.7`.
- Opus-target similarity must be `>= 1` to qualify for promotion.
