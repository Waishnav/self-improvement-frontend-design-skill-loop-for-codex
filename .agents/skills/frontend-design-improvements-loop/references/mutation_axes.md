# Mutation Axes

Apply one axis per experiment version for clean attribution.

## Allowed mutation axes

1. **First-fold compression**
- tighten hero text caps and above-the-fold payload.

2. **Section graph diversity**
- enforce distinct section graph ids and transitions.

3. **Typography identity**
- stronger display/body pairing constraints and anti-default guards.

4. **Spatial thesis**
- force one spatial rule per concept (asymmetry, strict grid, split narrative, layered).

5. **Interaction depth**
- hero interaction + component interactions with explicit success checks.

6. **Color system discipline**
- dominant/support/accent balance and stricter contrast rules.

7. **Anti-repetition guards**
- reject repeated skeletons and repeated container chains.

8. **Domain-specific copy pressure**
- enforce concrete product copy and reduce generic SaaS language.

9. **Mobile intent**
- explicit mobile-first composition checks.

10. **Reliability and overflow gates**
- reject broken scroll, hidden content, and accidental horizontal overflow.
