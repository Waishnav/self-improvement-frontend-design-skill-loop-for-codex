# T4 Canvas Prompt (Extracted From Video Screenshots)

## Base Prompt
I am building an image gen studio named "T4 Canvas". It is a power user interface for generating images with various AI models, including:

- Nano Banana Pro (from Gemini)
- Flux 2
- gpt-image-1.5
- Seedream

The image studio will enable users to generate and edit images using all of those models for a single, flat fee every month.

Your task is to build an incredible marketing homepage for this app. I want it to be creative and unique. Really push the limits of your design capabilities.

You have an empty directory here, I want you to initialize a project with the following specs:

- Vite
- Tailwind
- React
- Typescript
- Bun

Once initialized, I want you to create FIVE different designs.
Each design should be creative and unique from all the others that you create.
They should be hosted on /1, /2, /3, /4 and /5 respectively.

Use the following port for the dev server: 4000

## Variant A (No Skill)
Don't use any MCPs, skills, or other features in your harness.
Show me your organic built-in capabilities for tasteful design.

## Variant B (With Skill)
Use your frontend design skill to make these designs exceptional.
