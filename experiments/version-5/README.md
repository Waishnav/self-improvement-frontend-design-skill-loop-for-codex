# Version 5

## Hypothesis

Aggressive first-fold copy compression will reduce text clutter and produce cleaner, more visual compositions while preserving route clarity.

## Mutation Axis

First-fold compression (`references/mutation_axes.md`, axis 1).

## Exact Skill Change

Edited only `experiments/version-5/.agents/skills/frontend-design/SKILL.md` under `Text-heavy output` to tighten copy budgets:
- shorter hero and support copy caps,
- strict above-the-fold word limits,
- one supporting paragraph above fold,
- shorter section blurbs and mandatory prose reduction pass.

## Expected Visual Delta

Less verbose pages with more breathing room, stronger visual hierarchy, and fewer dense text blocks.

## Measured Result

Pending run and screenshot-based scoring.

## Keep / Drop

Pending.
