## Isolation Mode

## Skill Baseline

previous-version-skill

## Hypothesis

Enforcing explicit stateful interactions per route will increase perceived product realism and lift interaction quality without sacrificing layout polish.

## Mutation Axis

5. Interaction depth

## Exact Skill Change

Added an `Interaction Depth Guard` section in `SKILL.md` requiring hero-level stateful controls, additional mid-page interaction moments, visible feedback states, and rejection of static button-only pages.

## Expected Visual Delta

More obvious interactive behavior across sections (view switches, comparisons, filters, stateful panels) with improved UX credibility.

## Measured Result

Rubric score: **14.5 / 20** (average **1.45 / 2**), delta **+0.6** vs `version-15` (**13.9 / 20**).

Dimension scores:
- Distinctiveness: 1.8
- Hero composition quality: 1.6
- Section rhythm and transitions: 1.5
- Typography craft: 1.4
- Text economy: 1.4
- Interaction quality: 1.6
- Visual finish: 1.5
- Accessibility and contrast: 1.2
- Mobile quality: 1.2
- Opus-target similarity: 1.3

Outcome summary: the interaction-depth guard produced materially stronger product realism and stateful UX behavior across all five routes while preserving layout quality and visual diversity.

## Keep / Drop

Keep. Score improved and portability gate passed (no banned markers or benchmark/process leakage in `SKILL.md`).
