## Route-by-Route Critique

### /1

- Strengths: Clear command-center identity, strong hero hierarchy, and visible interaction states (model tabs, queue profile switches, billing toggle).
- Gaps vs expected: Copy density is still higher than ideal in mid-sections; some supporting text feels repetitive.
- Action items: Tighten supporting copy and increase information hierarchy contrast.

### /2

- Strengths: Editorial tone is coherent and the page now has practical interactive depth (program pills, storyboard switch, slider, accordion).
- Gaps vs expected: The beige palette and fine borders reduce punch in some modules; contrast is borderline in secondary text.
- Action items: Strengthen contrast tiers and simplify low-value helper text.

### /3

- Strengths: High distinctiveness with strong brutalist voice plus explicit stateful controls across hero/profile/stack/plan surfaces.
- Gaps vs expected: Dense black-yellow treatment can feel heavy; spacing rhythm is slightly compressed in lower modules.
- Action items: Add selective spacing relief and micro-contrast tiers for readability.

### /4

- Strengths: Calm premium language with clear interactions (intent filter, river mode switch, model garden, billing toggle, quote carousel).
- Gaps vs expected: Supporting type is somewhat small in places; section boundaries are a little soft.
- Action items: Raise body text legibility and sharpen section separators.

### /5

- Strengths: Noir route has strong product credibility and broad interaction coverage (lens modes, persona filters, constraints, calculator, FAQ accordion).
- Gaps vs expected: Lower sections are visually consistent but slightly monotone; footer FAQ lacks a stronger close-out punch.
- Action items: Add one stronger terminal visual beat while preserving the restrained system.

## Cross-Version Notes

- What improved vs previous version: Interaction depth improved substantially across all routes with clear state changes and richer control surfaces, lifting perceived product realism.
- What regressed vs previous version: Slight increase in copy verbosity and occasional compression of spacing/contrast in secondary modules.
- Rubric (v16): Distinctiveness 1.8, Hero composition 1.6, Section rhythm 1.5, Typography craft 1.4, Text economy 1.4, Interaction quality 1.6, Visual finish 1.5, Accessibility/contrast 1.2, Mobile quality 1.2, Opus-target similarity 1.3. Average: 1.45.
- Keep / Drop decision: Keep (positive score delta and portability gate pass).
- Next mutation axis: Domain-specific copy pressure (axis 8).
