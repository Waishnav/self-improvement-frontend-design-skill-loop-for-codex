- `research/theo-screenshots-2k-clean/opus_iterations/`

## Route-by-Route Critique

### /1

- Strengths: Long-form structure appears and hero-to-proof-to-pricing flow is clearer than prior iteration.
- Gaps vs expected: Mid-page "Model Arsenal" region is under-filled and reads as placeholder space.
- Action items: Require payload minimum for every middle section (content + supporting visual module).

### /2

- Strengths: Strongest route in this run; balanced editorial rhythm, coherent type system, and complete pricing close-out.
- Gaps vs expected: Card surfaces and contrast tiers remain safe relative to more daring reference compositions.
- Action items: Preserve structure, increase visual tension with one stronger composition break.

### /3

- Strengths: Distinct neon control-room identity and clearer route depth than v13.
- Gaps vs expected: Large middle dead zone after shortcut heading; missing/weak module payload hurts finish quality.
- Action items: Enforce no empty interstitial spans and require section-density continuity checks.

### /4

- Strengths: Soft atelier direction is coherent and readable with meaningful testimonial/pricing narrative.
- Gaps vs expected: Significant whitespace gap between hero and gallery band reduces momentum.
- Action items: Add one transition section in gap areas or tighten vertical rhythm with stricter spacing caps.

### /5

- Strengths: Brutalist utility style is memorable and the lower value-ledger/pricing sections read clearly.
- Gaps vs expected: Top fold right column is sparse and route has abrupt vertical jumps.
- Action items: Add denser supporting modules near hero and smooth section cadence.

## Cross-Version Notes

- What improved vs previous version: Section depth and post-hero structure improved across all routes; pages no longer collapse into one-screen layouts.
- What regressed vs previous version: Finish density and rhythm consistency dropped in several routes due under-filled middle zones.
- Rubric (v14): Distinctiveness 1.6, Hero composition 1.4, Section rhythm 1.2, Typography craft 1.4, Text economy 1.4, Interaction quality 0.9, Visual finish 1.1, Accessibility/contrast 1.0, Mobile quality 0.9, Opus-target similarity 1.1. Average: 1.20.
- Keep / Drop decision: Keep (net positive delta vs v13).
- Next mutation axis: Anti-repetition guards (axis 7), focused on eliminating sparse/placeholder section patterns.
