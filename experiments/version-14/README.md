# Version 14

## Experiment Topology

vertical

## Isolation Mode

isolated-fresh-app

## Skill Baseline

previous-version-skill

## Hypothesis

Forcing explicit section-graph depth requirements will reduce short-page outputs and improve section rhythm versus `version-13`.

## Mutation Axis

2. Section graph diversity

## Exact Skill Change

Added `Section Graph Diversity and Depth Guard` rules in `SKILL.md` that require post-hero section count, macro rhythm breaks, non-repeated lower-half structure, and a clear close-out band per concept.

## Expected Visual Delta

Longer page structures, stronger mid/lower-page composition variance, and improved rhythm continuity across `/1.. /5`.

## Measured Result

Rubric score: **12.0 / 20** (average **1.20 / 2**), delta **+0.2** vs `version-13` (**11.8 / 20**).

Dimension scores:
- Distinctiveness: 1.6
- Hero composition quality: 1.4
- Section rhythm and transitions: 1.2
- Typography craft: 1.4
- Text economy: 1.4
- Interaction quality: 0.9
- Visual finish: 1.1
- Accessibility and contrast: 1.0
- Mobile quality: 0.9
- Opus-target similarity: 1.1

Outcome summary: page depth and section count improved materially, but visual finish consistency regressed in some routes due sparse middle bands and dead zones.

## Keep / Drop

Keep. Net score improved and portability gate passed.
