## Route-by-Route Critique

### /1

- Strengths: Hero model selector changes adjacent preview content clearly; workflow mode control updates pipeline card content with visible outcomes.
- Gaps vs expected: Still somewhat dense in the first two bands and keeps familiar control-board composition.
- Action items: Reduce one secondary utility strip above the pipeline section.

### /2

- Strengths: Editorial pacing remains strong and route now includes explicit stateful controls in the layout director band.
- Gaps vs expected: Interaction impact is modest and mostly local; could better affect surrounding content blocks.
- Action items: Make story/catalog state switch alter one additional downstream module.

### /3

- Strengths: Strong brutalist identity with clearer operational controls and mode switching in render profile monitor.
- Gaps vs expected: Contrast remains aggressive throughout; little relief in lower sections.
- Action items: Add one lower-contrast info band to improve cadence without diluting identity.

### /4

- Strengths: Lens selection and before/after compare produce concrete local content changes; good interaction-to-content coupling.
- Gaps vs expected: Card structure is still repetitive in the middle section.
- Action items: Replace one mid-page three-card row with a different module type.

### /5

- Strengths: Workflow navigator tabs provide visible content updates and stronger product-behavior storytelling.
- Gaps vs expected: Visual hierarchy is stable but similar dark-panel grammar persists.
- Action items: Introduce one more distinct visual module (media or diagram-led) to break panel rhythm.

## Cross-Version Notes

- Prioritized issue carried into this version: interaction depth remained shallow in `version-19` despite stronger typography and color diversification.
- What improved vs previous version: Interaction quality improved materially with more meaningful stateful controls that update nearby content in multiple routes.
- What regressed vs previous version: Slight increase in interface density on dark routes and continued reuse of panel-board layout grammar.
- Rubric (v20): Distinctiveness 1.9, Hero composition 1.8, Section rhythm 1.6, Typography craft 1.7, Text economy 1.6, Interaction quality 1.6, Visual finish 1.7, Accessibility/contrast 1.3, Mobile quality 1.2, Opus-target similarity 1.5. Average: 1.59.
- Keep / Drop decision: Keep (positive score delta and portability gate pass).
- Next mutation axis: Spatial thesis (axis 4).
