- `research/theo-screenshots-2k-clean/opus_iterations/`

## Route-by-Route Critique

### /1

- Strengths: Strong first-fold hierarchy, asymmetric card cluster, clear command-center identity.
- Failures: Lower half uses familiar dark-card patterns and could use one stronger compositional break.
- Comparison vs target sets: Nearer to Opus with-skill hero tension than prior runs, but still safer in lower module choreography.

### /2

- Strengths: Editorial grid voice is distinctive; typography and whitespace create premium rhythm.
- Failures: Mid/lower utility cards are less daring than references and reduce momentum.
- Comparison vs target sets: Matches targeted editorial references on tone; below Opus iterations on transition drama.

### /3

- Strengths: Dense terminal cockpit has strong visual identity and clear information hierarchy.
- Failures: Large decompression zone feels under-utilized on some breakpoints.
- Comparison vs target sets: Good domain-specific utility look; somewhat less layered than strongest Opus long-scroll examples.

### /4

- Strengths: Narrative card spine is readable and conceptually distinct from other routes.
- Failures: Overall page feels sparse and less visually assertive; limited wow moments.
- Comparison vs target sets: Falls short of Opus references in compositional tension and finish density.

### /5

- Strengths: Poster/brutalist treatment is memorable and high-contrast; strong typographic punch.
- Failures: Some components feel repetitive after the second fold.
- Comparison vs target sets: Close to targeted poster-like references; polish details still below top Opus outputs.

## Scored Dimensions (0-10)

- hierarchy: **8.4**
- originality: **9.1**
- polish: **7.8**
- responsiveness: **8.3**
- opus-likeness: **8.0**

## Cross-Version Notes

- What improved vs baseline reference (`version-10` scaffold): Clear route-level composition identity and stronger page-length completion.
- What regressed: Route `/4` and parts of `/3` under-deliver on finish density and interaction richness.
- Keep / Drop decision: **Keep**.
- Next mutation axis: interaction/motion or finish-detail polish (single-axis only).
