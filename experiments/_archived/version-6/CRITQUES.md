## Route-by-Route Critique

### /1

- Strengths: Clear gallery-first structure with meaningful section shifts (hero -> collection mosaic -> compare module -> CTA), closer to Opus-style modular rhythm than baseline.
- Gaps vs expected: Hero typography is strong but still safer than high-tension target examples; first-fold interaction is present but shallow.
- Action items: Push hero asymmetry harder and make first-fold controls visibly affect nearby content.

### /2

- Strengths: Swiss-data framing is coherent with readable tables, clean neutral palette, and strong information hierarchy.
- Gaps vs expected: Transition cadence is conservative and lacks one high-impact composition break seen in target references.
- Action items: Add a denser-to-sparser transition and one off-grid data highlight block.

### /3

- Strengths: Cockpit route communicates operator workflow clearly with panels and queue narrative.
- Gaps vs expected: Mid/lower surfaces look functional but not premium; interaction affordances are not consistently obvious.
- Action items: Increase state feedback clarity and add richer surface depth (tiered borders, emphasis states, spacing polish).

### /4

- Strengths: Story route has a readable chapter flow and clear problem-to-action sequencing.
- Gaps vs expected: Section silhouettes repeat card rails too often; rhythm is flatter than Opus story-scroll references.
- Action items: Introduce one sticky progression moment and one media-led break between text-led sections.

### /5

- Strengths: Strongest personality in this version, with memorable poster-web voice and high contrast.
- Gaps vs expected: Spacing and alignment consistency dip across lower modules; some detail states feel unfinished.
- Action items: Tighten vertical rhythm and normalize component edge spacing without reducing expressive typography.

## Cross-Version Notes

- What improved vs previous version: Better structural divergence across `/1.. /5`, clearer per-route identity, and less repeated skeleton behavior.
- What regressed vs previous version: Interaction depth and finish polish did not rise at the same rate as layout divergence.
- Keep / Drop decision: Keep.
- Next mutation axis: Interaction depth.
