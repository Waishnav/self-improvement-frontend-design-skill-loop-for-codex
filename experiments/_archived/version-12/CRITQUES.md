## Route-by-Route Critique

### /1

- Strengths: Strong display type and readable hierarchy; clean dark technical identity.
- Failures: Composition is compact and ends early; lacks long-scroll depth.
- Comparison vs target sets: Typography compares well, but Opus-like section rhythm is noticeably thinner.

### /2

- Strengths: Elegant serif-led editorial voice and strong readability.
- Failures: One-screen structure with minimal transition architecture.
- Comparison vs target sets: Tone aligns with targeted editorial references; underpowered compared with Opus iteration depth.

### /3

- Strengths: Cohesive mono/terminal typography with clear hierarchy.
- Failures: Limited composition breaks and short narrative arc.
- Comparison vs target sets: Good utility clarity; lower originality than stronger Opus examples.

### /4

- Strengths: Soft typographic styling and mobile readability are solid.
- Failures: Visual density and section count are low; weak tension.
- Comparison vs target sets: Considerably below Opus references for dramatic progression.

### /5

- Strengths: Deco typography is readable and premium.
- Failures: Minimal route depth; repetitive module structure after hero.
- Comparison vs target sets: Better than generic SaaS output, but not close to top Opus-with-skill richness.
