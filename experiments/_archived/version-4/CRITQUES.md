## Route-by-Route Critique

### /1

- Strengths: Strong asymmetric hero and off-grid routing panel; clear spatial break between hero, capability rail, and pricing dock.
- Gaps vs expected: Mid-page modules still use familiar card rhythm; less daring than top Opus spatial experiments.
- Action items: Introduce one larger freeform overlap section and reduce repeated rectangular module language.

### /2

- Strengths: Editorial structure remains clear and polished with improved section spacing and sticky chapter rhythm.
- Gaps vs expected: Copy density is high and visual hierarchy can feel text-heavy compared with target sets.
- Action items: Compress body copy and convert more explanation blocks into concise visual proof chips.

### /3

- Strengths: Control-room concept is coherent with clear metric hierarchy and stable contrast.
- Gaps vs expected: Spatial variation improves but lower half remains panel-heavy and predictable.
- Action items: Add one non-rectilinear composition moment and simplify repeated status blocks.

### /4

- Strengths: Clear gallery-first spatial thesis, good light-to-dark transition, and useful compare interaction.
- Gaps vs expected: Top fold still split into standard two-column card/hero arrangement.
- Action items: Push stronger asymmetry in first fold and reduce repeated rounded-card scaffolding.

### /5

- Strengths: Poster route remains highly memorable with strong typographic silhouette and clear CTA hierarchy.
- Gaps vs expected: Ribbon stack repeats heavily; less nuanced than `targetted-designs` references with richer sectional pacing.
- Action items: Keep poster identity but trim repeated strips and introduce one contrasting section type.

## Cross-Version Notes

- What improved vs previous version: Spatial separation between sections is clearer and route-level silhouette diversity improved.
- What regressed vs previous version: Text density remains too high in editorial/control routes; some modules still overuse card grids.
- Rubric (v4): Distinctiveness 1.7, Hero composition 1.6, Section rhythm 1.5, Typography craft 1.7, Text economy 1.4, Interaction quality 1.3, Visual finish 1.6, Accessibility/contrast 1.4, Mobile quality 1.2, Opus-target similarity 1.5. Average: 1.49.
- Keep / Drop decision: Keep.
- Next mutation axis: Domain-specific copy pressure with explicit text-minimization gates (axis 8).
