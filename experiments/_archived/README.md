### Broken Loop Configuration

- `version-3`
- `version-4`
- `version-5`

Reason: these runs were classified as broken due to an incorrect self-improvement-loop configuration that reused `version-2` as an implementation baseline.

### Non-Portable Skill Content

- `version-6`
- `version-7`
- `version-8`
- `version-9`
- `version-11`
- `version-12`

Reason: these runs included `frontend-design` SKILL instructions with explicit experiment/versioning markers, so they were not portable for general external reuse.
