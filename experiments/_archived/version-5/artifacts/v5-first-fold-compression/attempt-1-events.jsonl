Use when building or restyling web components, pages, dashboards, landing pages, React apps, HTML/CSS layouts, or any UI where originality, polish, and visual quality are critical. Enforce anti-slop rules, section-level layout diversity, typography quality, and interaction design.\n---\n\nBuild real, production-grade frontend code with intentional visual direction.\nCounter common GPT/Codex failure modes: text-heavy layouts, repeated section architecture, generic style fallback, weak contrast, and shallow interactions.\nPrioritize user constraints over this skill: framework, libraries, coding style, architecture, and file conventions always win.\nThis skill defines design outcomes and quality bars, not mandatory implementation tooling.\n\n## Portability and Conflict Resolution (Required)\n- Apply design guidance through the user's chosen stack and conventions.\n- Do not force specific tools or libraries unless the user asks for them.\n- Express decisions as transferable intent (hierarchy, rhythm, contrast, interaction feedback), then map to local primitives.\n- Implement tokens/themes using the project's native system (variables, utility config, theme objects, component tokens, etc.).\n- If preferences are missing, choose a minimal-dependency approach and keep it easy to migrate.\n- Reuse existing project patterns before introducing new abstractions.\n\n## Workflow (Required)\n1. Lock context quickly.\n- Identify audience, core task, tone, platform, and constraints.\n- If context is missing, make practical assumptions and proceed.\n\n2. Generate five distinct directions internally before coding.\n- Force real divergence in section architecture, composition, type system, and color strategy.\n- Pick one direction and commit.\n\n3. Define a direction contract before implementation.\n- Concept statement (one sharp phrase).\n- Font pair (display + body).\n- Token palette (dominant, support, accent, neutral).\n- Spatial rule (asymmetry, strict grid, split narrative, or layered canvas).\n- Signature element (one memorable motif).\n- Section graph id (from the Section Graph Library below).\n- Primary interaction mode (from Interaction Modes below).\n\n4. Implement a token system first.\n- Define reusable primitives for type scale, spacing, color, radius, borders, elevation, and timing in the project's preferred format.\n- Build components from those primitives, not ad hoc values.\n\n5. Implement section architecture with deliberate breaks.\n- Enforce the selected section graph.\n- Add at least two macro composition breaks after the hero.\n\n6. Add interaction depth.\n- Add at least one hero-level interaction moment.\n- Add at least two component-level interactions for pages, one for small components.\n\n7. Run quality gates and revise once.\n- Do not stop at first draft quality.\n\n## Hard Guards for Known Failure Modes\nText-heavy output:\n- Keep hero headline <= 8 words.\n- Keep hero supporting copy <= 14 words.\n- Keep total above-the-fold copy <= 55 words on desktop and <= 38 words on mobile.\n- Allow only one supporting paragraph above the fold; move all other explanation into visual modules.\n- Keep section description blurbs <= 18 words each.\n- Prefer labels, chips, metrics, and concise bullets over prose paragraphs.\n- Final pass rule: remove at least 30% of non-essential words if the page reads text-heavy.\n\nSection architecture repetition:\n- Treat each concept as a unique section graph, not a palette variation.\n- Do not repeat the same section order across concepts.\n- If generating multiple concepts, no duplicate section graph ids.\n\nStructural monotony:\n- Do not use the same hero composition more than once across concepts.\n- Do not run three consecutive sections with the same container style (for example: card-grid, card-grid, card-grid).\n- Add at least one full-bleed or off-grid section in each concept.\n\nReadability regressions:\n- Reject low-contrast text and clipped typography.\n- Reject blur/noise effects that reduce legibility.\n- Reject decorative layers that obscure content.\n\nGeneric defaults:\n- Do not default to Inter/Roboto/Arial/system as primary identity unless explicitly requested.\n- Do not default to purple-pink-blue neon gradients.\n- Do not default to generic \"SaaS hero + three cards + CTA\" structure.\n- Do not use fake terminal aesthetics unless context explicitly justifies it.\n\nReliability regressions:\n- Do not ship broken scroll behavior.\n- Do not hide critical content behind fixed overlays.\n- Do not ship obvious horizontal overflow on mobile unless intentionally designed and controlled.\n\n## Section Graph Library (Use as Families, Not Templates)\nUse one graph as a structural spine, then style it uniquely.\n\n- G1 Narrative Split: Hero split -> Capability rail -> Workflow strip -> Proof grid -> Pricing -> Footer.\n- G2 Editorial Flow: Manifesto hero -> Sticky chapter sections -> Model table -> Membership CTA -> Footer notes.\n- G3 Cockpit Stack: Command hero -> Status panels -> Inspector rail -> Queue/process timeline -> Pricing dock -> Footer.\n- G4 Gallery First: Media hero -> Collection mosaic -> Detail spotlight -> Compare slider -> CTA bar -> Footer.\n- G5 Poster Web: Typographic hero -> Framed statement blocks -> Feature ribbons -> Offer slab -> Footer tape.\n- G6 Neo Utility: Hard-edge hero -> Utility matrix -> Constraint/protocol section -> Feature ledger -> Pricing card wall.\n- G7 Quiet Luxury: Minimal hero -> Signature benefit band -> Refined cards -> Testimonial quote plane -> Pricing strip.\n- G8 Story Scroll: Hero scene -> Sticky storytelling sequence -> Key metrics board -> Offer reveal -> Footer.\n- G9 Swiss Data: Typographic masthead -> Data rows -> Comparison matrix -> Spec blocks -> CTA row -> Footer.\n- G10 Hybrid Canvas: Asymmetric hero -> Floating module cluster -> Tooling/process section -> Proof collage -> Pricing.\n\n## Macro Composition Breaks (Required)\nEach concept must include at least two of these:\n- Dense to sparse transition (or sparse to dense).\n- Grid to freeform overlap transition.\n- Light to dark surface transition (or inverse).\n- Static section followed by motion-led section.\n- Text-led section followed by media-led section.\n- Orthogonal layout followed by diagonal or layered composition.\n\n## Interaction Modes\nSelect one primary mode per concept. For multi-concept outputs, do not reuse the same primary mode.\n\n- I1 Kinetic typography hero.\n- I2 Scroll scene transitions (sticky sections or progressive reveals).\n- I3 Interactive comparison surface (tabs, segmented control, or switchable views).\n- I4 Procedural background motion (subtle and readable).\n- I5 Cursor-responsive accent behavior (restrained, never distracting).\n- I6 Card choreography (stagger, parallax, or progressive detail reveal).\n- I7 Data-panel live state feel (status, counters, or activity rhythm).\n\n## Modern Pattern Atlas (Recent, Reusable)\nUse these as pattern families, not copy-paste templates.\n\n- Bento product narrative: asymmetrical modular blocks with clear hierarchy.\n- Editorial mono-luxe: serif headlines, precise grid, restrained ornament.\n- Neo-brutalist utility: sharp borders, flat planes, heavy contrast, intentional rawness.\n- Quiet luxury SaaS: muted neutrals, premium spacing, subtle motion.\n- App cockpit: dense command surfaces, inspector rails, status modules.\n- Kinetic typography hero: oversized type as primary visual engine.\n- Story-scroll narrative: sticky scenes and section-driven transitions.\n- Gallery-first interface: media-dominant composition with lightweight chrome.\n- Soft-material depth: layered surfaces, controlled blur, tactile lighting.\n- Swiss data grid: strict rhythm, typographic rigor, restrained accents.\n- Experimental poster-web: expressive type, overlap, framing, and composition tension.\n\n## Composition Rules\n- Establish a clear first-view focal point.\n- Use one spatial thesis consistently.\n- Balance one dense zone with one breathing zone.\n- Use scale contrast, overlap, or framing to create hierarchy.\n- Design mobile intentionally; do not only collapse desktop.\n- In five-route outputs, assign a distinct spatial thesis per route (for example: strict split, off-grid overlap, stacked strips, asymmetric cluster, poster plane) and avoid repeating adjacent theses.\n- Require at least one deliberate section-width shift per route (contained to full-bleed or full-bleed to contained) to break monotony.\n- Require one explicit off-grid anchor element per route (floating panel, diagonal slab, or overlapping frame) that remains readable.\n- Run a spatial audit before final output: if two routes share near-identical hero silhouette plus section-width cadence, revise one route.\n\n## Typography Rules\n- Pair one display face with one body face.\n- Keep font families to two maximum.\n- Use a fluid or stepped type scale appropriate to the stack and platform, with intentional line length.\n- Apply case, tracking, and weight as part of brand voice.\n- For five-concept outputs, assign explicit type pairs up front and do not reuse the exact same pair on more than two routes.\n- Give each route one visible typographic signature move (for example: drop cap intro, split italic phrase, vertical kicker, or condensed all-caps strapline).\n- Control hero line breaks intentionally so the first fold reads as designed rhythm, not browser-default wrapping.\n- Run a typography audit before final output; if two routes share nearly identical hierarchy, weight map, and rhythm, revise one route.\n\n## Color and Surface Rules\n- Tokenize palette in the project's native theming system (`bg`, `fg`, `muted`, `accent`, `accent-2`, `surface`, `border` semantics).\n- Keep one dominant chroma and sparse accents.\n- Validate text/control contrast.\n- Use gradients or textures only when conceptually justified.\n\n## Interaction and Motion Rules\n- Add one orchestrated entrance sequence.\n- Add meaningful hover/focus/active states.\n- Keep a coherent timing system (for example: 140ms, 220ms, 360ms).\n- Prefer native platform motion primitives first; add heavier JS animation only when state complexity requires it.\n- Respect reduced motion preferences.\n\n## Multi-Concept Protocol\nWhen asked for multiple designs:\n- Generate all concepts in one run.\n- Default to five concepts unless the user specifies a different count.\n- Enforce unique fingerprints across concepts:\n- Section graph id\n- Hero composition type\n- Primary interaction mode\n- Typography family\n- Palette temperature\n- Section rhythm\n- If concepts are shown in one app, provide a lightweight, stack-appropriate concept switcher.\n\n## Delivery Checklist\n- Production-ready implementation that runs in the requested stack without manual fixes.\n- Domain-specific copy (no placeholder or vague generic slogans).\n- Visible focus styles and readable contrast.\n- Desktop and mobile both polished.\n- Scroll behavior verified end to end.\n- One post-build refinement pass completed.\n\n## Self-Critique Quality Gate (Score 0-2)\n- Distinctiveness\n- Section-graph uniqueness\n- Layout originality\n- Text economy\n- Typography craft\n- Interaction quality\n- Accessibility and contrast\n- Responsiveness\n- Scroll and overflow reliability\n\nIf any score is below 2, revise before final output.\n","exit_code":0,"status":"completed"}}
