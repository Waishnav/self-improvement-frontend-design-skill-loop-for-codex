## Hypothesis

Stricter typography identity constraints will increase route-level personality and reduce repeated visual voice across `/1.. /5`, improving Opus-target similarity without harming readability.

## Mutation Axis

Typography identity (`references/mutation_axes.md`, axis 3).

## Exact Skill Change

Edited only `experiments/_archived/version-3/.agents/skills/frontend-design/SKILL.md` under `## Typography Rules` to add:
- explicit route-level type pair planning with anti-reuse constraints,
- one required typographic signature move per route,
- intentional hero line-break rhythm requirements,
- a final typography audit gate for hierarchy/rhythm duplication.

## Expected Visual Delta

More differentiated typographic character between routes, stronger first-fold headlines, and less samey headline/body hierarchy patterns.

## Measured Result

Compared against:
- `research/targetted-designs/`
- `research/theo-screenshots-2k-clean/opus45_with_skill/`
- `research/theo-screenshots-2k-clean/opus_iterations/`

Historical numbers below are retained only for traceability; this archived run is invalid for comparisons.

Rubric summary:
- Baseline `version-2` average: **1.23**
- `version-3` average: **1.44**
- Delta: **+0.21**

Biggest gains were in typography craft and route-level distinctiveness. Remaining gap is composition daring in mid-page sections for `/2` and `/3`.
