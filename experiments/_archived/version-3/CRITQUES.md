- `research/theo-screenshots-2k-clean/opus_iterations/`

## Route-by-Route Critique

### /1

- Strengths: Editorial serif direction is clear and less generic than v2; hierarchy and rhythm read well on first fold.
- Gaps vs expected: Compared with `opus45_with_skill`, composition tension is still conservative and section transitions stay mostly linear.
- Action items: Add one asymmetric composition break after the hero and a stronger visual motif in the mid-page modules.

### /2

- Strengths: Hero typography and script accent create stronger personality than baseline; cleaner text economy.
- Gaps vs expected: Still close to familiar dark dashboard language from prior iterations; lower novelty than top Opus examples.
- Action items: Push a non-rectilinear section break and diversify panel silhouettes after the first workflow strip.

### /3

- Strengths: Cockpit style is coherent with good metric hierarchy and strong readability.
- Gaps vs expected: Mid/lower sections rely on repeated rounded card blocks; interaction depth appears mostly cosmetic.
- Action items: Add one high-impact interaction surface (switchable comparison or timeline scrub) and vary module geometry.

### /4

- Strengths: Palette and typography differ clearly from /2 and /3; compare slider and model spotlight improve narrative.
- Gaps vs expected: Gallery modules still feel template-like relative to `targetted-designs` examples with stronger art direction.
- Action items: Increase visual daring in mosaic layout and add one large full-bleed media moment.

### /5

- Strengths: Strongest route in this run; typographic voice and color blocking are memorable and closest to high-energy references.
- Gaps vs expected: Footer tape and repeated ribbon blocks become repetitive; some text density is tight on smaller viewports.
- Action items: Keep poster direction but tighten repetition and improve mobile spacing around ribbons and CTA slab.

## Cross-Version Notes

- What improved vs previous version: Route-level typography identity is noticeably stronger; /1 and /5 show better first-fold character and clearer brand voice.
- What regressed vs previous version: /2 and /3 remain too close structurally (dark dashboard family), limiting section-graph divergence.
- Rubric (v3): Distinctiveness 1.6, Hero composition 1.6, Section rhythm 1.4, Typography craft 1.7, Text economy 1.5, Interaction quality 1.2, Visual finish 1.5, Accessibility/contrast 1.4, Mobile quality 1.2, Opus-target similarity 1.3. Average: 1.44.
- Keep / Drop decision: Keep.
- Next mutation axis: Spatial thesis (axis 4) to force bolder composition divergence after hero sections.
