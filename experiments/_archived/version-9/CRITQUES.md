## Route-by-Route Critique

### /1

- Strengths: Gallery architecture is complete and interaction-rich (aspect switch, model switch, compare slider), aligning better with Opus-style dynamic first-fold behavior.
- Gaps vs expected: Hero voice remains slightly safer than top reference tension; lower CTA finish can be refined.
- Action items: Increase hero typography contrast and sharpen final CTA visual hierarchy.

### /2

- Strengths: Swiss-data route has clear editorial hierarchy and meaningful focus-mode switching that updates nearby metrics.
- Gaps vs expected: Route depth is shorter than reference long-scroll pages; lower region ends abruptly.
- Action items: Add one proof rail and one feature/spec strip after matrix section.

### /3

- Strengths: Cockpit route now has explicit queue-mode states and lane switching, improving interaction credibility.
- Gaps vs expected: Visual language is coherent but less daring than strongest reference examples.
- Action items: Introduce one signature high-contrast module to lift memorability.

### /4

- Strengths: Story route now has chapter state controls and clear step framing with stronger narrative readability.
- Gaps vs expected: Sticky progression feel is still lighter than intended; transitions are mostly static.
- Action items: Add one true sticky scene handoff and stronger dense-to-sparse break.

### /5

- Strengths: Poster-web route is punchy, readable, and interaction-forward with mode switching and marquee rhythm.
- Gaps vs expected: Content stack is compact; needs one additional module to avoid early visual stop.
- Action items: Add proof collage or testimonial tape before footer for fuller closure.

## Cross-Version Notes

- What improved vs previous version: Stronger interaction depth across every route, better first-fold control clarity, and improved stateful behavior fidelity.
- What regressed vs previous version: Some routes are still shorter than ideal, leaving end-of-page dead space in captures.
- Keep / Drop decision: Keep (best current candidate).
- Next mutation axis: Mobile intent.
