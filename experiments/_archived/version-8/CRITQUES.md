## Route-by-Route Critique

### /1

- Strengths: Strong cinematic hero palette and cleaner contrast hierarchy than previous versions.
- Gaps vs expected: Content depth is too thin after first fold; route feels incomplete versus reference long-scroll examples.
- Action items: Add two substantive sections (proof and process) before final pricing block.

### /2

- Strengths: Best editorial execution in this run, with balanced typography, clean spacing, and clear chapter rhythm.
- Gaps vs expected: Mid-page module transitions are still conservative relative to target high-tension compositions.
- Action items: Add one deliberate grid-break composition in the middle third.

### /3

- Strengths: Highly distinctive poster-web voice with strong typographic energy and memorable silhouette.
- Gaps vs expected: After the headline burst, supporting sections are not deep enough to sustain narrative.
- Action items: Expand lower-half content with structured proof/feature modules.

### /4

- Strengths: Polished dark route with coherent color budgeting, strong card hierarchy, and clear conversion frame.
- Gaps vs expected: Interaction cues are present but mostly passive; fewer obvious state changes than desired.
- Action items: Add explicit stateful controls that alter nearby module content.

### /5

- Strengths: Quiet-luxury direction is tasteful, readable, and visually disciplined.
- Gaps vs expected: Route is over-minimal and drops into empty space too early.
- Action items: Increase section count and introduce one denser information band.

## Cross-Version Notes

- What improved vs previous version: Palette control and contrast quality improved overall polish.
- What regressed vs previous version: Route completion consistency and section density fell on several pages.
- Keep / Drop decision: Partial keep (retain color discipline rules, drop over-tight minimalism pressure).
- Next mutation axis: Interaction depth.
