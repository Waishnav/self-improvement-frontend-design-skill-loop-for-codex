## Hypothesis

Adding explicit interaction-depth gates should reduce static sections and improve perceived product quality through meaningful stateful UI behavior.

## Mutation Axis

Interaction depth

## Exact Skill Change

Added a version-specific interaction-depth gate with a fixed route-to-interaction mapping, plus hard checks for first-fold interactivity, stateful mid-page modules, and non-ornamental controls.

## Expected Visual Delta

More routes should show active controls, content-changing toggles, and clearer motion/state feedback without sacrificing readability.

## Measured Result

Interaction-depth gates increased meaningful controls and stateful modules across all routes, improving perceived product realism and reducing static-page feel. Scored `15.0/20` (avg `1.50`), best of this loop.

## Keep / Drop

Keep as current best candidate.
