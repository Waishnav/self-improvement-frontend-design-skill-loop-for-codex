## Isolation Mode

## Skill Baseline

## Hypothesis

Explicit anti-repetition and payload continuity guards will reduce sparse middle-page zones and improve visual finish consistency without sacrificing route diversity.

## Mutation Axis

7. Anti-repetition guards

## Exact Skill Change

Added `Anti-Repetition and Payload Continuity Guard` rules in `SKILL.md` to block repeated shells, prevent dead zones, enforce section payload minimums, and require replacement of spacer-only gaps with functional transition modules.

## Expected Visual Delta

Fewer empty interstitial spans, less repeated card scaffolding, and more continuous section momentum from hero to close-out.

## Measured Result

Rubric score: **13.9 / 20** (average **1.39 / 2**), delta **+1.9** vs `version-14` (**12.0 / 20**).

Dimension scores:
- Distinctiveness: 1.7
- Hero composition quality: 1.6
- Section rhythm and transitions: 1.5
- Typography craft: 1.5
- Text economy: 1.5
- Interaction quality: 1.0
- Visual finish: 1.4
- Accessibility and contrast: 1.3
- Mobile quality: 1.1
- Opus-target similarity: 1.3

Outcome summary: anti-repetition and payload continuity gates produced visibly denser, more complete pages with stronger narrative cadence and fewer placeholder gaps.

## Keep / Drop

Keep. Large positive score delta and portability gate passed.
