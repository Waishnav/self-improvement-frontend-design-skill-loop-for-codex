## Route-by-Route Critique

### /1

- Strengths: Strong command-center identity, clearer section cadence, and complete hero-to-pricing progression.
- Gaps vs expected: Still mostly static interactions (buttons without visible stateful panels).
- Action items: Introduce explicit interactive module states (tabs/toggles/compare surfaces).

### /2

- Strengths: High typography quality and balanced editorial rhythm with consistent section payload.
- Gaps vs expected: Mid-page cards could use one stronger visual interruption to increase memorability.
- Action items: Add one interaction-led chapter break.

### /3

- Strengths: Major improvement from v14; prior dead zone removed and content continuity is strong.
- Gaps vs expected: Dense data surfaces are clean but interaction affordances remain passive.
- Action items: Add active controls that switch benchmark views or queue states.

### /4

- Strengths: Curated/luxury route is complete and no longer has large whitespace gaps.
- Gaps vs expected: Visual language is elegant but conservative in motion/interaction.
- Action items: Add subtle but meaningful progression interactions.

### /5

- Strengths: Strong brutalist personality with coherent section density and readable hierarchy.
- Gaps vs expected: Could benefit from richer dynamic behavior beyond static metric tiles.
- Action items: Add one interactive comparison or filter block.

## Cross-Version Notes

- What improved vs previous version: Eliminated sparse placeholder spans, improved section payload consistency, and raised overall page completeness.
- What regressed vs previous version: Slightly higher content density risks reduced breathing space in some routes.
- Rubric (v15): Distinctiveness 1.7, Hero composition 1.6, Section rhythm 1.5, Typography craft 1.5, Text economy 1.5, Interaction quality 1.0, Visual finish 1.4, Accessibility/contrast 1.3, Mobile quality 1.1, Opus-target similarity 1.3. Average: 1.39.
- Keep / Drop decision: Keep (best in this run so far).
- Next mutation axis: Interaction depth (axis 5).
