## Route-by-Route Critique

### /1

- Strengths: Clear hierarchy and strong first-scan value prop; module sequencing is readable despite high-information theme.
- Gaps vs expected: Mid-page still carries more card payload than needed for a calm scan in this concept.
- Action items: Reduce one secondary metrics row or merge related card content to lower cognitive load.

### /2

- Strengths: Best pacing result in this version; generous breathing space, concise section copy, and clear editorial rhythm.
- Gaps vs expected: Slightly conservative interaction affordances; mostly static module behavior.
- Action items: Add one subtle, meaningful state change without increasing content density.

### /3

- Strengths: Strong brutalist identity with concise copy blocks and clean content chunking.
- Gaps vs expected: Visual aggression is high; lower section spacing could be a touch more relaxed.
- Action items: Add small vertical spacing relief between control matrix and final CTA band.

### /4

- Strengths: Cohesive terminal aesthetic and good structural ordering from hero to telemetry to access.
- Gaps vs expected: Intentional ops density still creates higher reading burden than other routes.
- Action items: Collapse one micro-module and simplify telemetry helper copy.

### /5

- Strengths: Strong breathing-space execution with clear sectioning, soft premium palette, and low-friction readability.
- Gaps vs expected: Interaction depth remains shallow and mostly button-led.
- Action items: Introduce one lightweight stateful control in the workflow phase strip.

## Cross-Version Notes

- What improved vs previous version: Better information pacing and reduced text crowding per section, especially in routes `/2` and `/5`; overall first-scan clarity improved.
- What regressed vs previous version: Interaction richness remains modest and a few routes still overpack utility content for their chosen visual tone.
- Rubric (v18): Distinctiveness 1.8, Hero composition 1.7, Section rhythm 1.6, Typography craft 1.6, Text economy 1.7, Interaction quality 1.1, Visual finish 1.6, Accessibility/contrast 1.3, Mobile quality 1.2, Opus-target similarity 1.4. Average: 1.50.
- Keep / Drop decision: Keep (positive score delta and portability gate pass).
- Next mutation axis: Mobile intent (axis 9).
