## Route-by-Route Critique

### /1

- Strengths: Strong signal-first hero, clear model lane hierarchy, and improved typographic identity versus previous dark concepts.
- Gaps vs expected: Still defaults to dense ops-card composition and high local contrast in mid/lower sections.
- Action items: Reduce one card row and shift one data block into a calmer narrative band.

### /2

- Strengths: Strong editorial pacing, cleaner spacing rhythm, and restrained tonal contrast aligned with softer references.
- Gaps vs expected: Interaction remains mostly static and card patterning is still familiar from prior editorial routes.
- Action items: Add one lightweight stateful module and vary one section away from card-list layout.

### /3

- Strengths: Meaningful palette diversification (soft violet/cream gradient) and improved playful tone without visual clutter.
- Gaps vs expected: Core structure still reads as stacked utility panels; limited visual media-led storytelling.
- Action items: Replace one utility panel block with a media-led section or visual narrative strip.

### /4

- Strengths: Distinct brutalist identity and clean information chunking with high clarity.
- Gaps vs expected: Contrast aggression remains very high and the matrix-board grammar repeats familiar control UI patterns.
- Action items: Preserve brutality while introducing one lower-contrast relief section to avoid all-density cadence.

### /5

- Strengths: Best calm-premium execution in this run; soft green palette and generous breathing space reduce cognitive load.
- Gaps vs expected: Interaction depth is shallow and sections are mostly static informational containers.
- Action items: Introduce one meaningful state change (mode/filter/toggle) with visible downstream content update.

## Cross-Version Notes

- Prioritized issue carried into this version: repeated typography/color signatures across concepts, especially recurring heavy hero weight stacks and high-contrast accent defaults.
- What improved vs previous version: Better style spread across routes with clearer typography archetype separation and broader contrast range (including soft tonal treatments); less “same palette family” repetition.
- What regressed vs previous version: Interaction quality did not improve materially; /1 and /4 still lean into recurring dense control-board composition.
- Rubric (v19): Distinctiveness 1.9, Hero composition 1.7, Section rhythm 1.6, Typography craft 1.7, Text economy 1.7, Interaction quality 1.1, Visual finish 1.6, Accessibility/contrast 1.3, Mobile quality 1.2, Opus-target similarity 1.5. Average: 1.53.
- Keep / Drop decision: Keep (positive score delta and portability gate pass).
- Next mutation axis: Interaction depth (axis 5).
