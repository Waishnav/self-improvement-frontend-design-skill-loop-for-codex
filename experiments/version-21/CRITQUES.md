## Route-by-Route Critique

### /1

- Strengths: Strong command-center hero with clear stateful model/preset controls and a cleaner close-out billing band.
- Gaps vs expected: Still uses familiar dark control-panel grammar and remains dense in upper bands.
- Action items: Replace one utility card strip with a calmer narrative or media-led module.

### /2

- Strengths: Editorial layout is meaningfully different from other routes; asymmetrical hero and large visual slab improve pacing.
- Gaps vs expected: Interaction effects are relatively subtle and mainly local to one section.
- Action items: Make one editorial control update a downstream section for stronger interaction consequence.

### /3

- Strengths: High-energy arcade concept with distinct macro structure and clear module hierarchy.
- Gaps vs expected: Contrast aggression is high and content density spikes in mid-page.
- Action items: Introduce one low-contrast relief band to improve reading cadence.

### /4

- Strengths: Brutalist black/white grid breaks prior dark-glass repetition; queue simulator adds explicit functional interaction.
- Gaps vs expected: Visual mood is intentionally severe and may reduce broad appeal for softer use cases.
- Action items: Add one softer secondary surface while preserving brutalist backbone.

### /5

- Strengths: Organic atmospheric composition with asymmetrical right-side scene capsule and differentiated section choreography.
- Gaps vs expected: Mid/lower sections still rely on repeated card containers.
- Action items: Swap one card cluster for a more diagram-led or editorial strip module.

## Cross-Version Notes

- Prioritized issue carried into this version: repeated panel-board macro-structure across concepts despite stronger interaction depth in `version-20`.
- What improved vs previous version: Structural variety increased materially; concepts no longer feel like the same wireframe with palette swaps.
- What regressed vs previous version: Interaction depth remained solid but slightly less emphasized in some routes compared to `version-20`.
- Rubric (v21): Distinctiveness 2.0, Hero composition 1.8, Section rhythm 1.8, Typography craft 1.8, Text economy 1.6, Interaction quality 1.5, Visual finish 1.7, Accessibility/contrast 1.3, Mobile quality 1.2, Opus-target similarity 1.5. Average: 1.62.
- Keep / Drop decision: Keep (positive score delta and portability gate pass).
- Next mutation axis: Mobile intent (axis 9).
