## Route-by-Route Critique

### /1

- Strengths: Strong cinematic hero hierarchy, clear dark-mode control deck, and good first-fold readability.
- Gaps vs expected: Page ends quickly with limited section progression; lower modules fall into a familiar three-card strip.
- Action items: Force at least two additional section types after hero and introduce a stronger dense-to-sparse transition.

### /2

- Strengths: Editorial serif voice is distinctive and typography quality is high.
- Gaps vs expected: Composition is essentially one-screen; section cadence and narrative depth are far below reference sets.
- Action items: Add chapter-like mid and lower bands with one contrasting composition break.

### /3

- Strengths: Bold brutalist identity with strong visual memorability and clear value proposition.
- Gaps vs expected: Supporting content is thin; after hero the route has minimal structural escalation.
- Action items: Expand with workflow/proof modules and one interaction-led section.

### /4

- Strengths: Soft gradient art direction and polished card surfaces feel premium.
- Gaps vs expected: Layout skeleton is close to `/1` (left hero + right stack + lower cards), reducing cross-route divergence.
- Action items: Enforce more distinct section graph and non-card middle section.

### /5

- Strengths: Operational cockpit theme is coherent with clear metric and model framing.
- Gaps vs expected: Route remains compact and panel-heavy; little long-scroll storytelling.
- Action items: Add at least one proof rail and one conversion band to complete page rhythm.

## Cross-Version Notes

- What improved vs previous version (if applicable): Better first-fold clarity and cleaner spacing/contrast than many earlier raw outputs.
- What regressed vs previous version (if applicable): Section depth, narrative length, and interaction complexity are below expected benchmark quality.
- Rubric (v13): Distinctiveness 1.4, Hero composition 1.5, Section rhythm 0.7, Typography craft 1.5, Text economy 1.4, Interaction quality 0.8, Visual finish 1.3, Accessibility/contrast 1.2, Mobile quality 1.0, Opus-target similarity 1.0. Average: 1.18.
- Keep / Drop decision: Keep as run seed baseline (first iteration in this run).
- Next mutation axis: Section graph diversity (axis 2), focused on page-depth and rhythm expansion.
