## Route-by-Route Critique

### /1

- Strengths: Better first-fold hierarchy and stronger product framing than v1.
- Gaps vs expected: Hero still relies on familiar split layout patterns.
- Action items: Increase asymmetry and reduce predictable card-grid behavior.

### /2

- Strengths: Clear editorial direction with consistent type system.
- Gaps vs expected: Section transitions are clean but conservative.
- Action items: Add one high-impact composition break to avoid monotony.

### /3

- Strengths: Cockpit concept reads clearly and supports power-user story.
- Gaps vs expected: Some surfaces look functional but not visually premium.
- Action items: Refine spacing and contrast tiers for stronger finish quality.

### /4

- Strengths: Media-first direction and interaction hooks are stronger.
- Gaps vs expected: Mid-page modules can feel repetitive.
- Action items: Diversify module silhouettes and rhythm across bands.

### /5

- Strengths: Strongest personality in this version; memorable typographic voice.
- Gaps vs expected: Needs tighter consistency in spacing and alignment across sections.
- Action items: Enforce stricter layout grid while preserving expressive tone.

## Cross-Version Notes

- What improved vs previous version: Better concept divergence, clearer identities, stronger overall art direction.
- What regressed vs previous version: Some concepts trade readability/finish for style intensity.
- Keep / Drop decision: Keep as current benchmark baseline.
- Next mutation axis: Fine-finish quality gate (spacing/contrast/mobile) without losing divergence.
