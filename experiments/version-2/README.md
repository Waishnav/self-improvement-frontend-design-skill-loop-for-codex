# Version 2

This iteration benchmarks a high-art-direction marketing implementation for **T4 Canvas**.

## Scope

- New app scaffold in `t4-canvas/` using Vite + React + TypeScript + Tailwind + Bun.
- Five intentionally different homepage concepts, exposed at `/1` through `/5`.

## Skill Tuning Intent

Reason for this version's skill application:
- Stress-test `frontend-design` guidance for divergence quality across multiple concepts in one run.
- Verify anti-slop constraints: distinct layout graphs, distinct typography systems, and meaningful interaction design.
