## Route-by-Route Critique

### /1

- Strengths: Dark spatial mood is distinct and avoids generic white SaaS defaults.
- Gaps vs expected: Page is under-filled with excessive negative space and insufficient content modules; fails target depth and cadence.
- Action items: Enforce minimum section payload and require two additional mid-page content bands.

### /2

- Strengths: Grid-led editorial masthead and matrix region are clear and readable.
- Gaps vs expected: First fold spends too much space on ornamental emptiness; lower half drops into dead area.
- Action items: Convert decorative empty zones into functional modules (benchmarks, proof strip, CTA bar).

### /3

- Strengths: Workflow narrative is coherent and section ordering is understandable.
- Gaps vs expected: Visual intensity is muted; component shapes repeat with minimal compositional tension.
- Action items: Add stronger scale contrast and one high-impact signature module.

### /4

- Strengths: Better compositional balance than other routes, with useful card cluster hierarchy.
- Gaps vs expected: Repeated blue blur cards create monotony and reduce memorability.
- Action items: Break pattern repetition with a contrasting surface language in one middle band.

### /5

- Strengths: Editorial typography has a premium base tone and clearer message hierarchy.
- Gaps vs expected: Route remains too short relative to other concepts and loses momentum after pricing.
- Action items: Add proof/feature rail and richer footer closure to avoid abrupt drop-off.

## Cross-Version Notes

- What improved vs previous version: Spatial thesis produced cleaner route-level intent in a few sections.
- What regressed vs previous version: Completion depth, rhythm continuity, and module density regressed across multiple routes.
- Keep / Drop decision: Drop.
- Next mutation axis: Color system discipline.
