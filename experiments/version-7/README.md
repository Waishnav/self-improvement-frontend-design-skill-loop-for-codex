## Experiment Topology

horizontal

## Isolation Mode

## Hypothesis

Enforcing a strong spatial thesis per route should improve compositional intentionality and reduce safe, centered layouts.

## Mutation Axis

Spatial thesis

## Exact Skill Change

Added a version-specific spatial thesis gate requiring each route to commit to one spatial strategy with measurable composition checks and no thesis reuse.

## Expected Visual Delta

Stronger asymmetric tension, more memorable silhouettes, and clearer dense-to-breathing-zone contrast.

## Measured Result

Spatial-thesis forcing increased conceptual contrast but over-constrained execution, producing under-filled routes and large dead zones on multiple pages. Scored `9.0/20` (avg `0.90`), regression vs `version-6`.

## Keep / Drop

Drop as full mutation; salvage only selective asymmetric-composition checks.
