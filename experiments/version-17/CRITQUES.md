## Route-by-Route Critique

### /1

- Strengths: Copy is direct and capability-led; hero value proposition is concise; supporting modules use concrete workflow language.
- Gaps vs expected: Lower section depth is still limited to a few broad modules; micro-label contrast is borderline in some pills.
- Action items: Add one additional post-hero structural beat and tighten secondary contrast tiers.

### /2

- Strengths: Editorial composition stays coherent while copy remains specific to production outcomes and operational gains.
- Gaps vs expected: Some helper lines are still longer than needed; mid-page rhythm has similar card cadence across bands.
- Action items: Compress secondary lines and introduce stronger section graph contrast.

### /3

- Strengths: Brutalist route has strong voice with concise operations-first messaging and clear control semantics.
- Gaps vs expected: The route is visually punchy but section progression is short; close-out treatment is minimal.
- Action items: Enforce deeper section sequencing and a more deliberate closing narrative band.

### /4

- Strengths: Cleaner copy and better product specificity in mood/workflow modules; strong tone consistency.
- Gaps vs expected: Large hero block dominates overall rhythm; later sections could diversify layout archetypes more.
- Action items: Push section graph diversity after the first fold to avoid repeated card-shell rhythm.

### /5

- Strengths: High premium polish with concrete workflow language and clear mode differentiation.
- Gaps vs expected: Interaction affordances are present but section variety after hero is still conservative.
- Action items: Increase layout variation and transition logic across lower-half modules.

## Cross-Version Notes

- What improved vs previous version: Text economy and domain specificity improved noticeably; copy feels more product-real and less generic across all five routes.
- What regressed vs previous version: Interaction density is slightly lighter on some routes, and post-hero section rhythm still converges on similar card patterns.
- Rubric (v17): Distinctiveness 1.8, Hero composition 1.7, Section rhythm 1.5, Typography craft 1.5, Text economy 1.7, Interaction quality 1.5, Visual finish 1.5, Accessibility/contrast 1.3, Mobile quality 1.2, Opus-target similarity 1.4. Average: 1.51.
- Keep / Drop decision: Keep (positive score delta and portability gate pass).
- Next mutation axis: Section graph diversity (axis 2).
