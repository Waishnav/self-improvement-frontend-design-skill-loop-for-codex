## Route-by-Route Critique

### /1

- Strengths: Strong neon/cinematic atmosphere and clear top-level value proposition.
- Gaps vs expected: Visual system still feels closer to AI-default landing style than Opus-level composition tension.
- Action items: Push more structural contrast and less conventional hero-card hierarchy.

### /2

- Strengths: Better thematic shift into control-deck language.
- Gaps vs expected: Lower visual originality; section rhythm is simpler than target references.
- Action items: Introduce more deliberate transitions between dense and sparse zones.

### /3

- Strengths: Poster-like energy and stronger typography voice.
- Gaps vs expected: Brutalist elements are present but not consistently refined.
- Action items: Tighten spacing logic and reduce accidental visual clutter.

### /4

- Strengths: Softer premium tone and calmer palette.
- Gaps vs expected: Feels safer and less memorable than expected target examples.
- Action items: Add a signature motif and a stronger first-fold focal lock.

### /5

- Strengths: Better narrative flow and command-surface metaphor.
- Gaps vs expected: Still somewhat generic in component language compared to top Opus examples.
- Action items: Increase uniqueness in module geometry and interaction choreography.

## Cross-Version Notes

- What improved vs previous version: Major jump from boilerplate scaffold to differentiated concepts.
- What regressed vs previous version: Inconsistent polish across all five routes.
- Keep / Drop decision: Keep as baseline for anti-slop improvements, but not final quality target.
- Next mutation axis: Section graph diversity + stronger typography identity constraints.
