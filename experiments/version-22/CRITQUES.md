## Route-by-Route Critique

### /1

- Strengths: Strong editorial print identity with warm paper palette, serif-led hierarchy, and calmer pacing than prior dense control-board heroes.
- Gaps vs expected: Mid-page still leans on repeated rounded-card rows; interaction consequence is visible but subtle.
- Action items: Replace one card grid with a more visual narrative module (timeline, collage rail, or media strip).

### /2

- Strengths: Distinct neo-grotesk command aesthetic, stronger control density, and clear stateful engine selection behavior.
- Gaps vs expected: Information load remains high in hero and queue bands; dark treatment keeps contrast mood relatively narrow.
- Action items: Introduce one higher-whitespace relief section and reduce one row of utility chips in first fold.

### /3

- Strengths: Soft pastel route is clearly differentiated with rounded geometry, gentle hierarchy, and lighter emotional tone.
- Gaps vs expected: Lower sections reuse similar card containers, limiting structural surprise.
- Action items: Swap one lower card cluster for a more editorial split or diagram-led block.

### /4

- Strengths: Brutalist route has decisive typographic voice and high-contrast hierarchy; strong macro separation from other routes.
- Gaps vs expected: Visual severity can reduce broad-use flexibility; red highlight band and dense caps increase reading fatigue.
- Action items: Add one calmer neutral band and reduce all-caps pressure in secondary copy.

### /5

- Strengths: Terminal mono-forward style is distinct and cohesive, with clear retro-tech atmosphere and strong thematic consistency.
- Gaps vs expected: Long-page legibility drops in darker sections and fine text; monochrome bias compresses scan hierarchy.
- Action items: Increase text contrast and add one secondary surface tone to improve readability and section distinction.

## Cross-Version Notes

- Prioritized issue carried into this version: recurring typography/color defaults and route-to-route style sameness.
- What improved vs previous version: explicit style-family locking materially increased typographic and chromatic diversity; routes now read as distinct design systems rather than minor palette swaps.
- What regressed vs previous version: accessibility/contrast consistency remains uneven in high-style dark routes; mobile intent was not directly improved.
- Rubric (v22): Distinctiveness 2.0, Hero composition 1.8, Section rhythm 1.8, Typography craft 1.9, Text economy 1.7, Interaction quality 1.6, Visual finish 1.8, Accessibility/contrast 1.3, Mobile quality 1.3, Opus-target similarity 1.7. Average: 1.69.
- Keep / Drop decision: Keep (positive score delta and portability gate pass).
- Next mutation axis: Mobile intent (axis 9).
